## Boilerplate for Zer0net web applications

Hello Zero is a Zer0net boilerplate with all the necessary elements to start a new project without the need to configure and develop the same features again and again.

It includes a default set of directories and files so you can start coding your new Zer0net site. The default JSON files are preconfigured with a set of usual defaults and the ZeroApp.coffee file includes some methods that you can re-use and customise to suit your needs.

It also includes documentation and examples you can copy and paste to bootstrap your projects faster.
